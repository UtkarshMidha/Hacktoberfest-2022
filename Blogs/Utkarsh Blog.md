Ranked mode maps will be divided into two categories: general maps and new-season maps.
General maps include maps that players are already familiar with and have been balanced.
New-season maps include new maps that are added into Rank Mode for the first time and old maps which have been improved and modified. 
Players who are below Pro rank can only play general maps. Those above Pro rank can play maps from either map pool which are randomly selected during the voting stage.
Note that these two maps being voted on must come from the same map pool

A new protection mechanism will be added when players choose maps under the new-season category.
